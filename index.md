We challenge you to join us for our 5K trail run and 1 mile fun walk~trot.  The 5K trail run will take you off road through our scenic equestrian facility.  Enjoy the beautiful flora and fauna (plants and animals for you city folk) as you follow the trail around Whisper Lake and through our wooded property.  In the event that we experience rainy weather in the days before the race, be prepared, our trail run will become a mud run.  (At no extra charge, of course!)  The 1 mile fun walk~trot will take you along the unpaved entry road into Bakas.  Have fun while supporting a dedicated cause!
